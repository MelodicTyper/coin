# Design
It's been a while since I've programmed. I started out on Khan Academy's html sandbox, where I could program simple, plain vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS. As I've used more advanced frameworks like Svelte, I've found finishing projects more difficult. So, I went back to basics and used vanilla HTML, with the benefits of Vite for developement.

## AI Usage
I've found AI robs me of the joy of writing code, so for this project that was for fun, AI wrote 0 lines of code. I used it to help generate some ideas for actions in the game.
